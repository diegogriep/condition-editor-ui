# Condition Editor UI

The best editor in the world :)

## Hello there 👋

Available on <https://condition-editor-ui.vercel.app/>

I've split the work on a [project](https://github.com/users/diegogriep/projects/3) like a Kanban with my thoughts and commits relations.

1. I did the UI part first, the data was only HTML. I tried to make the application compatible with small devices.
2. Integrate the filters between them.
3. Get the data from the datastore file as a service.
4. Join the filters with the "dynamic" data. This was the hard thing to do because there were different criteria.
5. Unit testing. I've tried to cover all scenarios. (You can run the test with `yarn test`)

Time spent: 13 hours + 2 hours for testing.

Thank you! 🙏
