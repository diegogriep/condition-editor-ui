# Condition Editor UI

The best editor in the world :)

## Hello there 👋

Available on <https://condition-editor-ui.vercel.app/>

I've split the work on a [project](https://github.com/users/diegogriep/projects/3) like a Kanban with my thoughts and commits relations.

1. I did the UI part first, the data was only HTML. I tried to make the application compatible with small devices.
2. Integrate the filters between them.
3. Get the data from the datastore file as a service.
4. Join the filters with the "dynamic" data. This was the hard think to do because there were different criteria.

Time spent: 13 hours.

Thank you! 🙏
